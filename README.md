# **Family Search**
Family Search is a search engine that uses Google Programmable Search Engine.
The difference is we use the safe search feature that google provides and go the extra step. Fmaily Search also has sites that are filtered out that are
known as mixed sites (e.g. reddit, twitter, etc.). However, not everything is perfect. So reasonible steps should be taken from the user as well
